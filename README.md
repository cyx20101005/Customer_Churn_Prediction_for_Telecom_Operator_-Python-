# Customer Churn Prediction for Telecom Operator (Python)
 
- Developed algorithms for Telecom service vendors to predict customer churn probability with labeled data
- Preprocessed data by data cleaning, categorical features transformation and standardization
- Trained supervised learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and KNN, and fine-tuned regularization params to against overfitting via grid search and cross-validation
- Evaluated model performance through ROC curve and confusion matrix, and analyzed feature importance to identify top influential factors, including daily call time and number of customer service calls
